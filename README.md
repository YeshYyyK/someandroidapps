# someandroidapps
A collection of apps for Android, with a focus on FOSS/free open source software



### Preface
#### Why FOSS and open source software?

 FOSS matters as it, by nature of being open, protects both privacy and security. FOSS matters as it lets people learn and share. FOSS matters as it is quite literally, 'freedom' from companies and organizations. FOSS matters as you have more power over the software, instead of the other way around; it is your hardware, you should be able to do what you want on it.
